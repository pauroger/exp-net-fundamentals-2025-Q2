# Cloud Formation Automation

See full list of settings in the [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md).

```sh
chmod +x projects/week1/env_automation/bin/deploy
```

Run it from root:

```sh
./projects/week1/env_automation/bin/deploy
```

## Shortcommings

To run this section, you will need to update all the variables in the deploy
script.

For the first run, remember to uncomment the currently commented out section of the
deploy script.

If this would have to be reused often, the 2 points above would have to be
addressed. For the scope of the Bootcamp, I consider the current setup as 'good
enough', and will now move to the next sections.
