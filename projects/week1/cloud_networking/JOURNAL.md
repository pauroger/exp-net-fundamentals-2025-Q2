## AWS

Created two VPCs: `bootcamp-test-vpc` and `bootcamp-test-peer-vpc`, and
configured them to send traffic to each other via VPC peering.

To enable traffic between the VPCs, you need to update the route tables:

- bootcamp-test-peer-subnet-public1-eu-west-1a (CIDR: 10.100.0.0/20)
- bootcamp-test-subnet-public1-eu-west-1a (CIDR: 10.65.1.0/28)

First, go to the route table associated with the main VPC (non-peer), and add a route pointing to the peer VPC.

Next, configure the peer VPC to allow return traffic to the main VPC.

## Azure

Creating the two virtual networks (VNets) in Azure is very similar to AWS. The
main difference is that peering is mutual by defaultâ€”you only need to configure
it once if you check the option:

>Allow 'bootcamp-test-vnet' to access 'bootcamp-test-peer-vnet'

## GCP

The key difference in Google Cloud is that VPCs are global, and subnets are
defined per region. For example:

Also, firewall rules apply at the VPC level, not the subnet level.
