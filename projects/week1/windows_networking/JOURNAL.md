## Developer Enviroment

![VM Screenshot](assets/vm_example.png)

I am using the Azure VM whtat we set up in the 
[IP Management project](../ip_address_management/JOURNAL.md).

## IPConfig

```sh
PS C:\Users\adminuser> ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration


Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : rvdgfzub0lyejptsxespcg2gld.ax.internal.cloudapp.net
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::e885:4f9:97f6:9b3a%5
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.0.0.4
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.0.0.1
```

Command used to do IP configurations in Windows, we see a list of our adaptors
and IP addresses.

- Ethernet adapter Ethernet: virtual Ethernet network interface (i.e., wired
  connection or virtual NIC in a VM or cloud environment).
- Connection-specific DNS Suffix: Automatically assigned by Azure.
- IPv4 Address: private IP range (10.0.0.0/8).
- Subnet Mask: This tells the computer which IP addresses are in its local
network.
- Gateway: This is the router IP the system uses to communicate outside the
  local subnet (e.g., to the internet or other networks).

## Ping

```sh
PS C:\Users\adminuser> ping -t www.youtube.com

Ping statistics for 142.251.36.14:
    Packets: Sent = 9, Received = 9, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 1ms, Maximum = 1ms, Average = 1ms
```

The ping command is a network diagnostic tool used to test connectivity between
your computer and another device (like a website or IP address). It sends ICMP
echo requests and waits for echo replies, measuring:

- If the destination is reachable.
- How long it takes (round-trip time).
- If any packets are lost.

## Trace Route

```sh
PS C:\Users\adminuser> tracert www.chess.com

Tracing route to www.chess.com [104.18.139.67]
over a maximum of 30 hops:

  1     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  2     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  3     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  4     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  5     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  6     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  7     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  8     *        *        *     Request timed out.
```

tracert (trace route) shows the path your packets take to a destination by
sending packets with increasing TTL (Time to Live) values. Each router along the
path should reply with an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message â€” allowing you to see
each hop.

On the example: no reply was received from any hop. Likely cause:

- Azure blocks inbound ICMP: Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and default
  router/firewall settings often drop or ignore ICMP Time Exceeded messages,
  which tracert relies on.

## Netstat

PS C:\Users\adminuser> netstat

`netstat` (network statistics): active network connections, listening ports, and
other low-level network stats.

On the example we are seeing active TCP connections from the VM (10.0.0.4) to
various remote servers.

The `route` commands shows Network interfaces available on the system. This is
useful for understanding how the machine decides where to send outbound
traffic.

With the print argument we can see the all active IPv4 routes.
