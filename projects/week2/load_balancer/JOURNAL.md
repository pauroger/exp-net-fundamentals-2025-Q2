## High-Level Overview

A **Load Balancer** is a networking component (hardware or software) that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It's a key part of high-availability, scalable systems.

Why is it used?

- High Availability: If one server goes down, traffic is routed to healthy ones.
- Scalability: More servers can be added or removed dynamically to handle
  demand.
- Performance Optimization: It reduces latency by directing traffic to the
  closest or least busy server.
- Fault Tolerance: Health checks identify and bypass unresponsive servers.
- Security: Can hide internal server structure and offer basic DDoS protection.

Types of Load Balancing

- Layer 4 (Transport): Balances traffic based on TCP/UDP ports & IPs.
- Layer 7 (Application): Balances based on content (e.g., URL, headers) - HTTP,
  HTTPS
- Global Load Balancer: Routes users based on geography - DNS-based.

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a cryptographic protocol used to secure
data transmitted over a networkâ€”primarily across the internet. It ensures that
the connection between two endpoints (like a web browser and a server) is
private, authenticated, and tamper-proof.

## Lab

Installed Container Lab's in an Ubunto box in Azure.

**Squid** is a high-performance caching and forwarding HTTP proxy server. It
supports a wide range of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.

- Squid acts on behalf of internal users to access the internet. Benefits:

  - Content caching (faster access, reduced bandwidth)
  - Access control (block websites, enforce policies)
  - Logging & auditing
  - Anonymity (hides internal IP addresses)

- Reverse Proxy (Server-side). Used to:

  - Load balance traffic across multiple web servers
  - Cache static content closer to users (improving performance)
  - Isolate backend infrastructure from direct public exposure
  - Support virtual hosting with intelligent request routing

On this lab: We will be using Squid as a reverse proxy to test routing to a
backend Windows IIS server.

This lets you simulate how a real load balancer or application gateway might route requests in production.

We edited the `/etc/squid/squid.conf` to include:

```sh
acl Safe_ports port 8080 # reverse proxy

http_port 8080 accel vhost

cache_peer 10.0.0.4 parent 80 0 no-query originserver name=iis-server

acl site dstdomain proxy-demo

http_access allow all

cache_peer_access iis-server allow site
```

Go back to the Windows box and set up the server. Make sure to add the Role `IIS Server`.

Then, on my local maching, add the public IP from my Windows Box.

```sh
4.231.104.245  proxy-demo
```

For the traffic to reach squid, I had to create a custom security rule:

We could then access the server, via reverse proxy, from our local machine.
